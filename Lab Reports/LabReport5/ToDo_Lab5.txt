CONCLUSION
The purpose of this lab was to use our measurements from the horizontal launch of a ball, to predict the distance when the same ball was launched at an angle. By applying the equations of kinematics a & recognizing the independence of a motion's horizontal & vertical components, we were able to make our calculations. First we measured the average distance of the ball, when launched horizontally, after conducting 5 launches. We measured an average distance of 1.231 meters (see Figure ____). With a standard deviation of _______ meters (Figure _____), our measurements were precise. We measured the height of the gun to be ______ meters (Figure ____) &, applying equation _________, we determined the ball's time in the air to be _______ seconds (Figure ____).  Using equation _______, we determined the initial velocity of the ball to be ______ m/s.
	Our calculations for the distance the ball would travel when launched at an incline of 40 degrees, required us to split the initial velocity into horizontal and vertical components. Since we did not change the compression of the gun, only the angle, we used the initial velocity for x that we calculated in Table _______. Applying equations _____ & _____, we calculated the horizontal distance the ball would travel to be _____ meters (see Table _____). The standard deviation of our trails were precise. While most of our trials were within 10\% error, our highest were 12.92\% & 10.81\% (Table _____). The

\subsection{Horizontal Gun}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Measured height of the gun above ground using a \textbf{meter stick}.
		\item Fired gun, then measured distance travelled. 
		\item Marked where the ball landed on the ground with tape.
		\item Repeaated steps 1-3, five times to calculate average distance.
		\item With the average distance and height of the gun above the ground, used equations of kinematics to calculate the ball's time in the air and initial velocity.
	\end{enumerate}	

\subsection{Inclined Gun}

	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item Guessed where the ball would land, marking our expectations with tape.
		\item Inclined gun to  $40^\circ$.
		\item Measured new height of the gun above ground.
		\item Calculated expected time in the air and horizontal distance using the initial velocity found in step 5.
		\item Marked expected distance on the ground with tape.
		\item Shot ball from the angled gun five times.
		\item Calculated average distance and standard deviation of trials in step 4.
		\item Repeated steps 6-12 at a different angle.
	\end{enumerate}

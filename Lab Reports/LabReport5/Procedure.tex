%Free Fall

\subsection{Free Fall}

\subsubsection{Setup}

	\begin{enumerate}

		\item Plugged in \textbf{Accessory Photogate Timer} into Ch. 1 on \textbf{Lab Pro} interface
		\item Opened \textbf{Logger Pro}
			
		\item Tested sensor by pressing \textit{"collect"} on \textbf{Logger Pro}
	\end{enumerate}	

\subsubsection{Measure Times \& Find Acceleration}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]

		\item Dropped \textbf{picket fence} vertically through \textbf{Photogate Timer}
	
		\item Recorded data from \textit{Velocity vs Time} plot

		\item Calculated slope of velocity by hand and record your calculations

		\item Used the linear regression function on \textbf{Logger Pro} to find the average velocity of the object

		\item Saved graph of acceleration

		\item Repeated steps 4-5, five more times and recorded the average acceleration of the trials
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Inclined Plane}

\subsubsection{Setup}

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Connected \textbf{Motion Detector} to \textbf{Lab Pro} 
		\item Tested sensor by pressing \textit{"collect"} on \textbf{Logger Pro}
		\item Placed sensor at bottom of track
		\item Used a \textbf{meter stick} to measure 0.40\thinspace m of distance between the motion sensor and the cart and marked it.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Starting at the Top}

	\begin{enumerate}[resume]

	\item Held cart at marked spot and released it
	\item Recorded average acceleration of linear region in the data using linear fit function in \textbf{Logger Pro}
	\item Repeated steps 5-6 another three times 
	\item Calculated and recorded average acceleration of cart during the four trials
	\item Used \textbf{meter stick} to measure D and h of the track as described in figure \ref{fig:inclineplane} to calculate angle of track using equation \eqref{eq:2}
	\item Calculated difference between average acceleration in trials and acceleration from equation \eqref{eq:2}
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsubsection{Starting at the Bottom}

	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
			\item Practiced pushing cart up track at least 0.40\thinspace m from the motion sensor
			\item Recorded motion of track when moving from the bottom and calculated its acceleration.
			\item Repeated and recorded motion trial three more times, then calculated average acceleration
		\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Which trials in part 1 did you seem to have the most difficulty with? Was it the heavier masses or the lighter masses?}

		We had more trouble with the lighter masses. 

	\item \textbf{Describe some ways that error was present in your lab today.}
 
	The biggest source of error in the lab was not following directions properly. Instead of swinging the rubber stopper such that the alligator clip remained 1 cm below the tubing, we attached MORE alligator clips and swung the stopper such that the centripetal force exceeded the weight of the stopper below. Our measured velocity ended up being way higher and consistent than it should have been. 

\item \textbf{Which experiment (part 1, 2, etc.) did you have the most difficulty with, why do you think that was the case?}

Since we didn't follow directions properly in part 1, part 3 ended up being the most difficult. I think this was the case because as the radius increased, we needed to find the right speed to balance the weight of the hanging mass at the bottom. We got close but the results would have aligned with our expectations more if we practiced doing the experiment properly the first time.   

\item \textbf{Which experiment (part 1, 2, etc.) did you have the most difficulty with? Why do you think that was the case?}

Our own data shows no correlation, but using algebra, we'd expect the centripetal force to increase as the velocity increased.

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Measured and recorded mass of \textbf{glider.}

		\item Spaced \textbf{photo gates }air track and recorded distances.

		\item Set \textbf{photo gate }to \emph{PULSE }mode.

		\item Let \textbf{glider }across air track three times, and determined the
			glider's \emph{average kinetic energy}.

		\item Measured height from table top to crease in air track to find the change
			in vertical position, \emph{H}.

		\item Calculated change in \emph{gravitational potential energy }using measurements
			from steps 1-5.

		\item Repeated steps 1-6 for a different height and mass.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Part 1}

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Measured 20 cm of \textbf{string} between \textbf{rubber stopper }and
			\textbf{tubing}.

		\item Clipped \textbf{alligator clip }1 cm below \textbf{tubing}.

		\item Tied \textbf{mass hanger }and 45 g of weight to \textbf{string}.

		\item \textbf{**} Added more \textbf{alligator clips }to \textbf{string }to prevent it
			from going into \textbf{tubing}.

		\item \textbf{**} Practiced swinging \textbf{rubber stopper }in a horizontal circle such
			that the bunch of \textbf{alligator clips }stopped right at \textbf{tubing}.

		\item Once comfortable with speed of swing, recorded time needed for 20
			cycles (complete revolutions) to pass.

		\item Calculated time for 1 revolution by dividing time recorded by number of
			cycles timed for (20).

		\item Calculated \emph{centripetal force }using weight of hanging mass.

		\item Calculated \emph{average velocity }using \emph{average period}.

		\item Repeated steps 3 through 9 for 60 g, 70 g, and 80 g of weight.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Part 2}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
			\item Measured mass of \textbf{rubber stopper}.			
			\item Calculated \emph{expected velocity} for \textbf{rubber stopper} using its measured mass.
			\item Determined \emph{percent error} between expected and \emph{measured period}.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Part 3}
	\begin{enumerate}[resume]
		\item Placed 70 g on 5 g \textbf{mass hanger}.
		\item Measured 0.1 m for length of \textbf{string} between \textbf{rubber stopper} and \textbf{tubing}.
		\item Repeated steps 4-9 for 0.15 m, 0.2 m, and 0.3 m. \\
	\end{enumerate}


	\noindent ** \textbf{INCORRECT}: Deviated from lab instructions. The tubing string was supposed to be swung at a speed such that the alligator clips stayed 1 cm below the tubing.

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Found the center of the \textbf{meter stick} by going to the halfway
			point (0.5 m).

		\item Placed \textbf{knife edge clamp }on the \textbf{meter stick.}

		\item Slid \textbf{knife edge clamp }on \textbf{meter stick }until \textbf{meter
			stick }was balanced on the \textbf{knife edge }support.

		\item Recorded center of mass of the \textbf{meter stick}.

		\item Attached 60 g of mass to the \textbf{meter stick} at 20 cm from one
			end.

		\item Recorded distance of the 60 g to the pivot point.

		\item Placed 100 g on the \textbf{meter stick }such that it remained balanced.

		\item Solved for the actual placement position of the 100 g using center of mass
			equation.

		\item Attached 20 g of mass to the \textbf{meter stick }at 10 cm from the end
			on the same side as the 60 g.

		\item Adjusted placement of the 100 g so that the \textbf{meter stick }remained
			balanced.

		\item Repeated step 8.

		\item Removed all attached masses.

		\item Placed 50 g of mass on the meter stick at 20 cm from one end.

		\item Moved \textbf{knife edge }placement such that the \textbf{meter stick's
			}center of mass changed.

		\item Solved for \textbf{meter stick's }center of mass using center of mass equation.
